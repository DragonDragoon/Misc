Moodle2 Course Expander
====
About:
As of the recent update to Moodle2, the page no longer displays "My Courses" for the current semester automatically.
Having to open it for every time a user wants to view a class seems tedious.

This UserScript is aimed to simulate the user clicking to the current semester automatically.


Instructions:
====
1) For Firefox:
     Install <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/">Greasemonkey</a> Firefox Add-on.

2) Visit the <a href="https://github.com/DragonDragoon/Misc/raw/master/JavaScript/Moodle2-Course-Expander/Moodle2CourseExpander.user.js">Raw</a> version of the script.

3) Add the UserScript to the browser.
